                    through movement, and it’s found in every culture 
                    around the world. Throughout history, dance has been 
                    used to tell stories, celebrate events, and connect 
                    with others. By looking at its meaning, history, and
                     cultural importance, we can better understand how 
                     dance has shaped societies everywhere.</p>
